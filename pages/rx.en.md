# Rx

## What is Rx?

`Rx` is the abbreviation for [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/). `ReactiveX` is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It extends [the observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to support sequences of data and/or events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O.

Rx supports almost all the popular programming languages, YoMo uses [RxGo](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxGo) and also adds some new `operators`. YoMo built atop [Functional Reactive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) to reduce the complexity of `streaming computing`.

## Why use Rx?

For the senario of continuous high-frequency data, for example, IoT devices generate data in 24 hours. The data needs to be processed in real-time through streaming computing, and the learning cost of streaming computing is very high.

The ReactiveX (Rx) Observable model allows you to treat streams of asynchronous events with the same sort of simple, composable operations that you use for collections of data items like arrays. It frees you from tangled webs of callbacks, and thereby makes your code more readable and less prone to bugs.

```js
getDataFromNetwork()
  .skip(10)
  .take(5)
  .map((s) => s + ' transformed')
  .subscribe((it) => {
    console.log('onNext => ' + it)
  })
```

YoMo uses `QUIC` protocol to transfer data, and abstracts `QUIC Stream` into `RxStream` in [yomo-flow](/flow). It supports all operators provided by [RxGo](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxGo) library, and adds several new operators for YoMo scenarios.

## Supported operators in RxStream

### New Operators in YoMo

- AuditTime - ignore for given time then emit most recent item
- StdOut - print the item in standard output
- Subscribe - observe the key of streaming data via [Y3 Codec](https://github.com/yomorun/y3-codec-golang)
- Y3Decoder - trigger the callback function and decode the data while the key is observed by [Y3 Codec](https://github.com/yomorun/y3-codec-golang)

### Transforming Observables
